### HTML

* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
* All html files starts with <!DOCTYPE html>.This specifies which language we are using.
* Every html file has 2 parts,a head and a body.Head contains information of title of our webpage and body has all the headings,paragraphs,images etc.
* Anything written between <>'s is called a tag.For example h1 tag,p tag,a tag etc.
* Tags describe the html language.
* <tag>content</tag> is called an element.
* Attributes are also written within <>.These tell us more information about an element.Ex:href for a tag,src for img tag,etc.
* There is an attribute style which specifies font properties i.e it gives styling to our font.
