## HTML

* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
* All html files starts with <!DOCTYPE html>.This specifies which language we are using.
* Every html file has 2 parts,a head and a body.Head contains information of title of our webpage and body has all the headings,paragraphs,images etc.
* Anything written between <>'s is called a tag.For example h1 tag,p tag,a tag etc.
* Tags describe the html language.
* <tag>content</tag> is called an element.
* Attributes are also written within <>.These tell us more information about an element.Ex:href for a tag,src for img tag,etc.
* There is an attribute style which specifies font properties i.e it gives styling to our font.
* <div> is used to divide webpage into parts
* <span> is used to highlight any particular word.

## CSS

* CSS stands for Cascading Styling Sheet
* HTML provides the skeletal structure of a webpage whereas CSS provides the Styling
* For a html file to access a css file, this element <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="xyz.css"> needs to be written between head tags.
* Any html element can be a CSS selector.Ex: <h1></h1> has a CSS selector h1.
* Attributes of an element are specified in its CSS selector in .css file.
* text-decoration:none. This implies text is not underlined.
* Certain selectors override others if they have greater specificity value.Ex:u li p{} is more specific than p{},So when CSS sees tags that are both <p> and within unordered lists then most specific styling is applied to that tag.
* Classes are used when a group of elements require same styling.Classes are declared in css file by writing a dot infront of classname.
* ID's are required when only one element needs a special kind of styling.
* pseudo selectors are used to highlight a font or image whose information cannot be extracted from document tree.For ex:which links are visited,on which link is our current mouse pointing to etc.It's syntax is:
	selector:pseudo-class_selector {
    	property: value;
	}
